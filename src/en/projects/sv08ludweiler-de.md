The club homepage of SV 08 Ludweiler was already based on a Joomla CMS. First, it was updated to the latest version and moved to an own virtual server.

The site was given a modern, responsive theme in material design, so that the site is finally usable on mobile devices.

To ease administration, fu√üball.de widgets for each team were integrated, so that the games, results and tables do not have to be updated manually. In order to be able to automatically display the next game of a team (for which there is no widget), a widget from fupa.de was integrated on the start page.

The page is availalable at <a href="https://sv08ludweiler.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sv08ludweiler.de</a>.

By hosting on an own server and administrate the domain, an own mail server was set up, so that the members of the board and the divisions could be provided with their own email.
