 SightSeeking is an playable guide of Paris which was created as part of the seminar 'Tangible Maps'. The main component is the Microsoft Surface table which displays the card material of Paris.  We printed any sights of Paris with an 3D printer and equipped all with unique tags which can recognized by the table surface.

 The goal of the game is to place the sights at the correct location and orientation on the card. Depending on the distance to the correct location, the user earns points. In the second modus, the user can put an sight on the surface and get further information about it.
