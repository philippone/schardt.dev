In cooperation with one fellow student, we developed an restaurant recommender. Therefore we created an database of restaurants in Saarbr√ºcken. Our recommending algorithm can already achieve good results with a few preferences of the user and additionally information about the context (location, time). An suitable user interface was implemented as an android app.
