In the first software practical, organized by Prof. Zeller,  groups of six students planned and developed the game 'The Settlers of the Saar' based on the board game 'The Settlers of Catan' in four weeks between the semesters. The game is a network based multiplayer in which the players act as a settler. Each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. They can also build catapults and destroy the enemies. The player who survives the game is the winner.

Each group implemented the standard game and also an artificial intelligence (Bot) which competed against the other Bots in an tournament at the end of the course.
