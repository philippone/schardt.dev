I developed this app on behalf of Prof. Malte Friese which is the head of the social psychology chair at Saarland University. The app was used to carry out reserach studies and was already used in Benjamin Jung's bachelor thesis. The main task of the app is to display one word and the user has to decide bewtween two answers. The settings of the task (the question, word lists, pauses and maskings between the words) can be set freely on an web interface.
