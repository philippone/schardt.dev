In the lecture 'Ubiquitous Media', we developed one of our first practical projects in cooperation with the artist Fred George. He presented his solar-piece sculpture on the campus of the Saarland University.
This sculpture provided the context of the project. It should be an interactive game which could be palyed on a multi-touchscreen integrated in the base of the sculpure.

We installed an Geo-Caching point at the location. The game is a mix of questions, puzzles and hidden pictures about the artist and his work. If the player could solve all puzzles he got the coordinates as result.
