This prototype was developed for the <a href="http://www.innovative-retail.de/" target="_blank">IRL (Innovative Retail Laboratory)</a> which generates approaches and finds solutions for the challenges of tomorrow in the context of retail. With the prototype the user can generate some lists and collect items by typing in their name, price and quantities. The special aspect of this app is the augmented reality part. The user can record the real life products with the camera of an smartphone and the app recognizes it in case the product is registered in the database.

The database is not filled up yet, i.e. the product information (name, prices, pictures) are missing.
