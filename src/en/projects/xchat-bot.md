Since 2018 Ergosign has introduced the Focus Time, which takes place once a month on a Friday for 4 hours. On this day all employees working on a (innovation) topic of their choice. Once a year this Friday is extended to a Group Focus Time, so that all colleagues from all locations work together on projects throughout the day.

A number of topics were pitched in advance in order to draw the attention of colleagues. So, I presented my topic of a chat bot and was able to motivate 8 other colleagues to do so.

On that day we finalized the goals and agreed to develop a chat bot, which helps to find colleagues ad-hoc and also makes it easier to find appointments and rooms.

In addition to a short research analysis of dialogues and the course of conversations, we were able to develop an MVP with the help of Google's Dialog Api. The MVP can answer questions of colleagues in our in-house chat tool Mattermost in a kind of conversation.
