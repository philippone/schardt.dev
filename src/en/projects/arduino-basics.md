In this workshop at the College of Fine Arts (HBK Saar), we learned the basics of Processing and Arduino. At the end of the course I developed an prototype. It was an glove with an arduino board (LilyPad) and an gyroscope. The objective was to controll an game in the Blender engine. Therefore I wrote also an plugin which transfered the gyroscope data into Blender.
