The ”Interactive Cube” is a cube which uses LED light as an output source. It was developed during a two weeks long timeframe. The prototype is a result of the seminar ”Affective Lighting” at the Saarland University in summer term 2015. The final cube consists of plexiglass and offers several functionalities such as displaying current time or temperature and can also act as an ambient light. In every mode, the appropriate information is represented by lighting patterns on the surface of the cube. The different functionalities are linked to a certain side of the cube and can be selected by rotating it.
