We developed an system for the student representative printer system. The system has at least one terminal with an touchable user interface which is capable to display the submitted print jobs and current status of the connected printers. Furthermore the system consists of an account system which handels the free copies of the students. The students can submit any print jobs in the universitary network until the credits are exhausted. Additionally, there is an offer to select and print the latest lecture material for free at the frontend. The credits of the students are linked with their student card. As one of the greatest features, the user can change the printing options at the frontend, e.g set orientation, page range, copies, duplex printing and so on.
