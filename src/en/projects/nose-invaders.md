<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hiwi.schardt.noseinvader" target="_blank">NoseInvaders</a> is an app for Android which was created as part of my work as research assistant. We wanted to know how accourate peaple can hit an object on an tablet with their nose. Thus, we developed an small game in which the people have one minute to hit as many as possible (Nose-)Invaders. We forced the people to permanently hold two buttons on the boarders of the screen and also ovserved the orientation and accelerometer data to avoid cheating.
