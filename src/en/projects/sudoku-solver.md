As a project in the lecture 'Programming for Ingenieurs', I had to implement an command line sudoku solver in C++. To make sure to find an solution (if solvable), I implemented five different solving strategies. The program had no GUI, the inputs are read from a text file, the results are displayed in the terminal.
