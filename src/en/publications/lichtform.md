In this paper we present an interactive shape changing light object that can be controlled through a smartphone applica- tion. The object is attached to the ceiling and comprises a matrix of 7 x 7 loosely coupled LED elements, hanging on stepper motors above at five points that lower and raise the corresponding parts of the object.
