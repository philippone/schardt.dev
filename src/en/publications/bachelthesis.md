Often, we operate mobile devices using only one hand. The hand thereby serves two purposes: holding the device and op- erating the touch screen with the thumb. The current trend of increasing screen sizes even further (i.e., up to 6-inch), how- ever, makes it close to impossible to reach all parts of the screen for users with average hand sizes. One solution is to offer adapted user interfaces for such one-handed interaction. These modes have to be triggered manually and thus induce a critical overhead. Furthermore, these adaptations do not ad- dress the handedness (i.e., the hand currently operating the device). In this paper, we present an algorithm that allows determining the handedness of the user from their unlocking behaviour. Our algorithms correctly distinguishes one- and two-handed usage as well as left- and right handed unlocking in 98.51% of all cases. This is achieved through a k-nearest neighbour comparison of the internal sensor readings of the smartphone during the unlocking process.
